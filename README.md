# Geohazard-Weather-Station_GPGN590
Multiparameter Geohazard monitoring station with Arduino
## Abstract
Geologic hazards, such as landslides or avalanches, pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Understanding the factors that influence these events is crucial for effective risk management and mitigation strategies. This project aims to develop a cost-effective weather station situated on a slow-moving landslide, utilizing low-cost instrumentation such as Arduino microcontrollers. The system will monitor key environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and movement patterns, which are essential for assessing landslide stability. By leveraging open-source technologies, we aim to provide an accessible solution that enables real-time data collection and analysis, fostering greater awareness of landslide behavior. The gathered data will enhance predictive models, support research efforts, and ultimately contribute to the development of early warning systems, thereby improving safety and preparedness in vulnerable regions. Through this project, we aim to demonstrate that innovative, low-cost solutions can play a vital role in addressing natural hazards and enhancing community resilience.
