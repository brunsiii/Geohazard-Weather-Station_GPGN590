        "Geologic hazards, such as landslides or avalanches, pose significant risks to communities, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Understanding the factors that influence these events is crucial for effective risk management and mitigation strategies. This project aims to develop a cost-effective weather station situated on a slow-moving landslide, utilizing low-cost instrumentation such as Arduino microcontrollers. The system will monitor key environmental parameters, including temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and movement patterns, which are essential for assessing landslide stability. By leveraging open-source technologies, we aim to provide an accessible solution that enables real-time data collection and analysis, fostering greater awareness of landslide behavior. The gathered data will enhance predictive models, support research efforts, and ultimately contribute to the development of early warning systems, thereby improving safety and preparedness in vulnerable regions.

        "<h2> Introduction </h2>\n",
        "Geohazards pose a danger to local ecosystems and communities, and without proper warning or detection, these hazards can prove to be devastating for unprepared areas. Landslides and avalanches, however, do have indications of land movement prior to failure (Muenchow et al., 2012). Things such as movement, rainfall, and soil humidity are indicators of a future landslide. For avalanches, things like snowpack, snowfall, and rapid temperature fluctuations are good indicators. In rural or remote settings, it is often difficult to have comprehensive, state of the art early warning systems such as ones monitored by the USGS with several monitoring stations and sensors, therefore these areas are more at risk of being unprepared for such events. Using low-cost instrumentation and data monitoring with Arduino microcontrollers and sensors, this project aims to close this gap. Additionally, there has been emphasis in recent years for early warning systems to be designed for local use to predict short-term behavior of individual slopes, opening a need for an instrument such as ours (Guzzetti et al., 2020).  \n",
        "\n",
        "Our design utilizes an Arduino MEGA2560 board to connect several sensors that are useful in early warning systems. Our design will have two stations, a base station and a “rover” that will sit on the slope to detect movement and direction, as well as temperature and humidity data to provide weather data that might show conditions that impact land movement. A case study we will use for implementation is the Slumgullion earthflow in the San Juan Mountains of Colorado. Slumgullion has been identified and monitored since the 1990s by the USGS to use it as a comprehensive study of landslide processes since it has been moving continuously for hundreds of years (The Slumgullion Earth Flow, 1996). We believe that since it is being studied in this way already, it would be a great case study for a different type of monitoring system. In this paper, we will go over the overall design of our instrument, the build and code details, and any future design work or implications that are revealed after testing.  "

        "<h3> Designing Two Stations</h3>\n",
        "The hardware for this project is based off projects done during class that expanded our knowledge of what the Arduino systems can do. We have combined several relevant in class assignments to create a robust detection system. The rover station will be placed at a point along the slope that is deemed optimal for detecting movement, and the base station will be placed alongside the slope at an area that is not detecting movement. We chose to design two stations for a couple reasons. One is that it is easier to access the base station for the data collection, as it will not be along the slope that is moving. Another is that the positions of the rover station relative to the base is a data point in itself. For data that is made for remote areas, a full analysis of movement may not be possible, but visual inspection of the two stations can be the first step at determining slope movement. A third reason is that we are able to put different monitors on the two stations. The base station can collect more stable data, and the rover can collect variable data, so as to not overload one station and lower cost of buying multiple sensors for each station.\n",
        "\n",
        "<h3> Components </h3>\n",
        "For both stations there needs to be a GPS detection system to detect location and subsequent movement. For this we used the BN-880 GPS module that connects to existing satellites to provide GPS latitude and longitude, and magnetometer data. These modules are connected directly into the Arduino board via jumper cables and a breadboard. Next, we need to include our weather monitoring, for this we used a BME 886 Temperature/Pressure/Humidity Sensor to detect temperature, humidity, and pressure, all indicators of precipitation. This goes only onto the base station as it is the most stable. Lastly, we need stations to communicate with each other and give the user access to the data. Xbee modules were used to have each station talk to each other and have the movement of the rover station communicated to the base station. Once this is communicated and any movement is calculated, the data is then printed via the XBee to an SD card. To protect the module from weather and other elements, we 3D printed a casing for the rover module.  "

        "There are no relevant safety considerations in the operation of the prototype in a lab environment. However, in use, one could be in an unstable environment such as a creeping slope, or in extreme weather conditions. The base station should be placed in a zone that is not in danger of being impacted by a slope failure, and reachable through all weather conditions. The rover station will be placed on a potentially unstable point on the slope, so it is important to use caution during deployment. A remote-controlled vehicle or drone could be used to place the rover station at the desired location, without the user having to put themselves at risk.\n",

        "This prototype uses several sensors that all need to be validated and calibrated. The first being the BN-880 GPS module that connects to external satellites to acquire GPS data. Through testing of this module, a connecting period of at least two hours needs to be built into the set-up process to allow the module time to connect to the satellites in the area. Once the module is connected, it will produce the GPS data via latitude and longitude until the module is shut off or disconnected. This connection timeframe will need to be implemented before each data collection period. All the sensor's precision can be amended by the user, allowing the user to determine the precision needed for measurement.  \n",

By continuously collecting data on temperature, humidity, soil moisture, and ground movement, the system provides a comprehensive view of the conditions that could lead to a landslide. This data will be analyzed to detect early warning signs, such as increasing soil moisture or subtle shifts in ground movement, which often precede slope failure. Early detection of these signs allows for timely interventions, enabling communities to implement preventive measures, such as evacuation or infrastructure reinforcement before a disaster occurs.\n",
